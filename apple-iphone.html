        <p>The Apple iPhone was first introduced in 2007. It changed how people used phones by combining a phone, an iPod, and a web browser into one device. The iPhone had a touchscreen, which made it easy to use without buttons. It also allowed users to download apps, making the phone useful for many tasks beyond calling or texting. The iPhone set the standard for modern smartphones and continues to be one of the most popular phones in the world.</p>

            The Nokia 1011 was released in 1992 and was one of the first mass-produced mobile phones that supported the GSM network. It was named after its launch date, November 10th (10/11). The phone could store up to 99 contacts and had a monochrome display. Unlike earlier mobile phones, the Nokia 1011 was smaller, making it more convenient to carry. It played a key role in making mobile phones more accessible to people around the world.</p>

        <p>The first mobile phone was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, released in 1983. It was large and heavy, weighing about 2.5 pounds, and could only make calls. The battery lasted about 30 minutes of talk time, and it took around 10 hours to charge. Even though it was expensive and bulky, it was the first phone that people could carry around and use without wires. This phone started the mobile phone industry, leading to the smaller, more advanced phones we use today.
